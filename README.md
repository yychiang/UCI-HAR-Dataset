# UCI-HAR-Dataset

This is a README file explaining the script of "run_analysis.R".
Mainly, the script does the following:
* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In order to explain the script clearly, we devide it into 8 parts as below.
#### Part 1
